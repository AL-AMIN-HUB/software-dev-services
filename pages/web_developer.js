              Why and How to Become a Web <br /> Developer?
            </h2>
            <p className="large">
              Web development is always scouting for new talents. Basically, you have three options: a career in front-end or back-end. What is the
              third? The final option means that you become a true mastermind in both of these fields. However, let’s walk before we run.
              <br />
              <br />
              Front-end developers are responsible for building the user interface. They decide on the colors, fonts, sizes, and all other visual
              elements. They work hand-in-hand with web designers or are capable of being both: front-end specialists and web designers. This field is
              preferred by many because your work leads to a clear-cut visual image.
              <br />
              <br />
              For back-end developers, the situation is a little different. They work under-the-hood, reassuring that the website functions correctly,
              connects to databases, and performs other critical tasks. Therefore, their work is invisible to the naked eye since visitors are more
              inclined to react to visual elements (at least initially).
              <br />
              <br />
              In this learning path, you will be introduced to the main programming and scripting languages for web development. You will have the
              chance to learn from professionals about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and the most widely used frameworks/libraries.
